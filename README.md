Trying to build an app that could predict the happening of natural disasters like flood , rain , cyclone etc.
By predicting this the people would aware before the natural disatser that some rain/cyclone is about to come. So, they could take a 
proper steps >>
      if it is a flood(before , during , after) 
      * Find the highest location near by and went there so that water could not come.
      * Estimated time to for flood to good a level of danager
      * keeping food with us.
      * Calling the local disaster management team so that they could do rescue opeartion
      
      if it is a rain
      * How much time the rain will last
      * Severity of rain (Severity could be low , mdeium , high)
      * During the rain we need to stay in home , so we should try to find the duration of rain when it stops
      * If it is a heavy rain , trying to call the nearby rescue team.
      
      If it is a cyclone
      * Need to know the speed of cycle
      * need to know the severity of cyclone based on it's speed.
      * If the severity is high we need to remain in house for some estimated period of time . So, finding time estimation.
      * After the cyclone try to locate the local disaster management team and tell them about the damage so that they 
        could make it correct . This reduces further damage to lives . Like sometimes a electricity pole get damaged so the wires 
        got accumulated on the road.
